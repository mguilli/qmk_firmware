// Information
/* Return an integer that corresponds to what kind of tap dance should be executed.
 *
 * How to figure out tap dance state: interrupted and pressed.
 *
 * Interrupted: If the state of a dance dance is "interrupted", that means that another key has been hit
 *  under the tapping term. This is typically indicitive that you are trying to "tap" the key.
 *
 * Pressed: Whether or not the key is still being pressed. If this value is true, that means the tapping term
 *  has ended, but the key is still being pressed down. This generally means the key is being "held".
 *
 * Good places to put an advanced tap dance:
 *  z,q,x,j,k,v,b, any function key, home/end, comma, semi-colon
 *
 * Criteria for "good placement" of a tap dance key:
 *  Not a key that is hit frequently in a sentence
 *  Not a key that is used frequently to double tap, for example 'tab' is often double tapped in a terminal, or
 *    in a web form. So 'tab' would be a poor choice for a tap dance.
 *  Letters used in common words as a double. For example 'p' in 'pepper'. If a tap dance function existed on the
 *    letter 'p', the word 'pepper' would be quite frustating to type.
 *
 * For the third point, there does exist the 'DOUBLE_SINGLE_TAP', however this is not fully tested
 *
